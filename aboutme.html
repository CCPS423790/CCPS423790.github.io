<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> I am working in my life to be able to become a professional doing nails or eyelashes, some experiences that led me to decide this was that I like when I went to do my nails and eyelashes I saw people who did it and I liked it, and a day I decided that I wanted to dedicate myself to that and be a professional. I am working in the same way that I practice. I learn many things about nail hygiene and more, so I put time and dedication to be able to achieve this. I try to practice every day and sometimes I also practice in the hands of other people. The values that I consider most necessary to achieve my success is to always try to have good hygiene with the clients' hands to avoid what type of fungus or something else, I also believe that it would be necessary to take good care of people so that they Like the service and each time the clients add more. The objective that I hope to achieve in a short step is to learn how to do nails well and also to be well prepared so that when I graduate from high school I can decide what I like and my career in nails and eyelashes. The traits for which I want to be more known is for doing a good job, a job that makes people happy and also always having good hands and natural nails equally.</P>
